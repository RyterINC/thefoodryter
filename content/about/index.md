# A little about myself

My name is Jayson! I live in Casselberry Florida and I have a deep love for food. Ever since I was a kid, I remember hovering around my mom while she was in the kitchen cooking delicious foods and asking her all sorts of questions. I remember wanting all of her recipes and how excited I was for one day having a kitchen of my own to do it myself. I'm a home cook and I love cooking new things and bringing new life into the old recipes I grew up on.

# What to expect

In my blog, I will be talking about all things food:
- Recipes
- Restaurant reviews
- Cooking theory
- Product reviews
- Flavor combinations
- Book reccomendations

Really as long as it involved with food and making food, I'll probably talk about it. I hope you enjoy the content and I'm always open to feedback. Feel free to reach out and let's make great food together!
