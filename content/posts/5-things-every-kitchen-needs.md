## Things you don't know you need, until you need them

Before you read this post, I don't want you to think that you can't be a great cook, or even cook a great meal with limited resources.
As long as you have drive, a pan, A utensil to handle the food, a heat source, and the ingredients, you can do great things. 
As you cook more and more, you will discover tools and equipment that may make your life a little easier. 

### 1. Olive Oil Bottles

Any chef who has been cooking for long enough knows olive oil is a staple ingredient. You will go through A LOT, of olive oil. So much in fact,
that it will probably begin to frustrate you when you try to poor olive oil in a control fashioned, and you either use too much, get it everywhere, 
or screw up the presentation of your dish because you got olive oil where you didn't want it.

An olive oil bottle makes all those problems go away. One for extra virgin, one for regular olive oil. It will make dressing salads easier, putting appropriate portions in food easier, and it will make you look cooler when you whip it out and poor it into a pan. You don't need something fancy, I got a set from Amazon kind of like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/PACK-Aozita-Glass-Olive-Bottle/dp/B07DKB4FFW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=oil+bottle+for+cooking&qid=1594256404&sr=8-1).

### 2. Cast Iron Skillet

Oh man. If you told me I had to cook on one pan for the rest of my life, I would choose my cast iron any day of the week. A cast iron skillet gives you even
 heating with food when cooking, you can put it in the oven under high heat, it will make any meal you cook taste ten times better since it gets continually seasoned, and it's incredibly versatile. A lot of new cooks might be intimidated by cast iron because people thing it's hard to clean or maintain, but to be honest it's easier to clean my cast iron than most pans in my kitchen, and a thin layer of canola oil will keep it looking fresh and rust free. If you're unsure of which to get, you won't go wrong with a [Lodge](https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Skillet-Pre-Seasoned-10-25-Inch-Silicone/dp/B00WTSCXIS/ref=asc_df_B00WTSCXIS/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198075681105&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6054211996255353180&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011742&hvtargid=pla-350991430228&psc=1).

### 3. A Big Cutting Board

If you don't think you need a big cutting board, try working on a small one for a while and I think you will change your mind rather quickly. Literally the first thing I 
got when I started cooking regularly was a big cutting board. Bottom line, you need space to work. I would always reccomend having more than one cutting board, but 
atleast one big one will get you a long way. A wooden board is more durable and won't dull your knives out as quickly. If you want to prevent your cutting board 
from slipping on a counter, wet a paper towel and lay it under the board. Again, you don't need anything fancy here. Just something wooden, big, and preferably with 
a juice groove around it. [Check one out here.](https://www.amazon.com/Extra-Organic-Bamboo-Cutting-Kitchen/dp/B00MW8NBW2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=wooden+cutting+board+big&qid=1594257853&sr=8-1) 

### 4. Dish Cloths, Lots Of Them

I realize not everyone uses dish cloths in the kitchen, mostly for sanitary reasons. For those of you who do, I want to stress the importance of having a lot of them...
Before I moved in with my girlfriend, I had only two dish cloths in my kitchen. Because I had so few, I washed them less and I was always freaking out when I was in the 
middle of cooking and I didn't have a cloth to wipe a counter, dry a utensil or do something that warranted the use of a dish cloth. Do yourself a favor and just go 
to the dollar store and buy ten dish cloths, a little basket, and put them on your counter. You will have them when you need them and when you are washing the used ones,
 you will still have clean clothes on hand. 

### 5. Meat Thermometer

I went for a very long time before I got a meat thermometer. Typically I don't cook a lot of thick meats, but when I do I'm absolutely am grateful that I have a thermometer
 on hand. Without it, you would have to cut open, or feel the meat for doneness. It's a lot easier to just stick a thermometer in a whole chicken to find out if it's 
cooked. Professional chefs use a thermometer and there is a reason why. It's accurate, it's quick, and it doesn't require you cutting open your food,
 ruining presentation later. Get yourself [something digital and cheap,](https://www.amazon.com/ThermoPro-Digital-Instant-Thermometer-Kitchen/dp/B01IHHLB3W/ref=pd_lpo_79_t_0/142-3326660-8980143?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01IHHLB3W&pd_rd_r=2ba7f8b8-dcbc-4885-b240-fd549484374a&pd_rd_w=YWJWV&pd_rd_wg=9CUHk&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=9NYKA1APCD3J35WT5RCW&psc=1&refRID=9NYKA1APCD3J35WT5RCW) it will go a long way.
