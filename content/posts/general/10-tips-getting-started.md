## So you want to start cooking?

Cooking is a lost art these days. With the ability to buy just about anything pre-made, who would ever want to spend hours in the kitchen prepping it themselves? Let's be frank, cooking takes time and practice. You need a kitchen that is stocked pretty well and you're going to mess up a lot of foods and recipes the first time you tackle them. 

Wow Jayson, you're really selling me on this whole cooking thing. 


With that being said, if I still didn't scare you away, then I will say there is a brightside. Being able to cook flexes your creativity and opens a whole new world of food that will greatly benefit your life. Cooking restaurant quality food at home will save you money, keep you healthier, and give you a sense of purpose in the kitchen. Your cooking utensils will be your sword and shield and your kitchen the battlefield in which you throw together ingredients like a mad scientists to come out with a creation you can be proud of at the end of the day. 

## Got it, give me the tips now please

Here are some things I wish someone would have shared with me when I got started on my path. Some of these may be obvious, but I intednded this to be for the lost soul who feels discouraged on getting started, or who might just need a little motivational boost to get going. 

### 1. Don't be afraid to fail

You will fail. You will make things badly. You will throw your garbage food outside and the raccoons might not even want it. You'll burn your sauce and your noodles will come out way overcooked. Accept it, move on, and take it as a learning experience. I can't tell you how many steaks, how many sauces, how many foods I've destroyed in the kitchen and I am sure more are to come. Chances are, whatever you cook will atleast be edible even if you didn't cook it right. Make notes, learn from your mistakes and try again another day. 

### 2. Start off with easy recipes

Seems like it's obvious right? Wrong. When I first started cooking I wanted to try things that frankly, were just too hard at the time. It's not that I couldn't produce a meal at the end, but there were a lot of steps, techniques that I were unfamiliar with, and many ingredients to work with. Some of my favorite recipes are the easiest ones. I suggest everytime you cook, focus on a new technique or use a new ingredient that you are unfamiliar with. For instance, maybe you cook a normal dinner for yourself but you also include broiled sliced tomatoes if you've never used a broiler before. Or maybe sautee some onions and mushrooms for your burgers next time. These small steps and practice sessions will help you tackle bigger recipes that might use a combination of these techniques or ingredients. 

### 3. Taste your food

If there is any one thing I hope you take away from this posts, it's that tasting your food is the number one way to improve your cooking. Seriously....TASTE YOUR FOOD. Don't just taste it when it's finished either, taste it at every step of the cooking process (if it's safe to eat of course). If it doesn't taste good in the beginning, it sure as hell won't taste good when you put it on the plate. Once you've tasted it, let your palette tell you what it needs. Not enough flavor? Add some salt. Too sweet? Add something acidic. Let your taste buds guide you and trust your instincts. 

### 4. Make the same recipe more than once

When I first got started I always wanted to try a different recipe every night. Now...I'm not saying this is a bad thing. Frankly, any cooking will improve your overall skills, but it's important to return to dishes. Master chefs and cooks have dishes they've made hundreds of times and the quality of the dish reflects. I once entered a chili cooking contest at work and made chili four times within a couple of weeks (I wanted to make more but we had way too many leftovers). It was only because I practiced my recipe and made notes, that I was able to impress everyone and go on to win. Plan, execute, adjust. This will really hone your skills and make your food much better. 

### 5. Get good knives

Pots and pans are whatever. Knives are essential. I used to work with a knife block set I bought on Amazon for sixty dollars. I *thought* I had good knives. I did not have good knives. Instead what I had was okay knives that would dull out quickly and didn't feel good in my hands when I used them. I then took the time to research high quality knives and bought some basic knives from the [Dalstrong brand on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/7AFD8071-3F34-47A9-B0DD-7FB5F9C8E77E?store_ref=SB_A06169141B2XSSHO05D5O&pf_rd_p=0695bfd4-f098-403d-ad0f-7db64c30b506&aaxitk=2jX4Ktt3Iz2NiRRR.Yr9hw&hsa_cr_id=7368570790601&lp_asins=B01M4G9ZNK,B01FXYVDEO&lp_mat_key=dalstrong%20knives&lp_query=dalstrong%20knives&lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_hl). What a game changer. Not only do I feel more confident cutting my ingredients, but sharper knives mean you use less force and are safer. I suggest that if you are serious about cooking, invest in these knives from a quality brand:

- Chef's knife
- Bread knife (serrated knife)
- Paring knife
- Sharpening stone

I realize the sharpening a stone isn't a knife, but if you are going to invest 100+ dollars in knives, get atleast a [basic whetstone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D23QJH9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to sharpen them. Also get a honing rod. You don't need to invest a lot of money, but having one is a must.

### 6. Use good ingredients

An awesome dish is just the sum of its parts. If you use bad ingredients, you'll get bad food. Have you ever been to a restaurant where you could tell that something was from a can or frozen prior? Like those crabcakes that you got at applebees's and gave you diarrhea that one time? Yeah. Don't be that chef. Get familiar with your grocery stores produce department and use fresh herbs and produce. Ask the seafood guy how long those scallops have been there before you buy them. Trust your senses. Is the steak you are about to buy brown because it's oxidizing? Get another cut. Smell the heavy whipping cream before you add it to your dish. Does it smell like that dead raccoon you saw on the highway? Chuck it. When in doubt, just replace it with something fresh. Your stomach will thank you for it. 

### 7. Don't get discouraged by the small stuff

This is something I struggled with when I was first doning my apron and throwing things together. I would always beat myself down for not knowing how to beat an egg, not knowing how long and at what temperature to roast those carrots for, not knowing how to properly clean a cast iron skillet, not knowing what pan to use for what, etc. Just relax. Breathe. These are all things you will learn in time. After cooking over and over again you will gain the knowledge through repition and you will eventually be able to cook based on your experience and less on the instructions of a recipe. 

### 8. Just let the food cook

Number one rookie mistake of most home cooks or chefs. They touch the food too much. Unless the recipe calls for you sauteeing something or actively mixing, just don't touch it. I think this is a problem among new cooks because they are afraid of burning their food, which I get but the more you touch it, move it, shift it, bop it, the more you affect its overall cooking. 

### 9. Be clean, but don't be a Nazi about it

I will admit, I am not the cleanest person in the kitchen. I tend to get food all over the stove and use more mixing bowls, pots, pans, and utensils than I care to admit. Find time in between things to put things in the sink to free up counter space. Wipe down the sauce you just spilled on the floor so you don't step in it. Slow down on your mixing if your contents are spilling over the edge. I find the easiest way to stay clean is to not be in a hurry. Make sure your ingredients are prepped before you start cooking and think about each stage of the process and what you will need. You don't need to go nuts, but being clean is an important part of the process and you need to instill good habits while you are just starting out. 

### 10. Cook for people and get feedback

Usually when I'm cooking it's just for me and my girlfriend. I know her palette pretty well and cater to it, as well as I know my own palette and cook to my own liking. However, the way I spice food may not be the way most people enjoy it. Whenever I have friends over I always ask them to give me an honest review of the food and what they liked, but also what they didn't like. Take this time to hone your recipes and get the necessary feedback to make your food better. That way when your mother in law who hates everything you make comes over, you will be prepared to make her eat her words and your food.
