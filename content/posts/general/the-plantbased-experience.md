## New eating habits, new me!

I wanted to take the time to write a blog post about how I've recently switched to a plant based diet. For all of you who don't know, plant based eating is simply not eating animal products. This is like veganism in the sense that I don't consume the products however, I am not vegan because I still wear leather, might wear a fur coat, etc...

I've been a meat eater my entire life. My dad always made steaks and grilled chicken, my mom always incorporated some meat protein into our meals. I love the taste of steak, 
and BBQ ribs had become almost a staple in my routine cooking. So why the change? Well, there are a few reasons. First, I've always flirted with the idea of going plant based or 
vegan because I genuinely do not like the mass harvesting of animals in a scale of which humans do it. 

## A small disclaimer

Please note, I do not think eating animals is wrong. 

To elaborate, I think during a simpler time of the human era when family farmers managed animals, grocery store chains weren't on every corner, and plant based eating was almost
 not existant, this was acceptable. Now that we live in the year 2020 and corporations like walmart harvest animals in the thousands, the impact it makes to our climate, the 
environment, and to the animals themselves is frankly, **irresponsible**. 

## Go ahead, give me a reason

Personally, I consider myself very educated. The human race overall is the most intelligent life (that we know of) in the universe, and most certainly on our planet. I think as 
humans evolve and as we start to create new foods and substitutes for animal products, the less we have to rely on eating animals themselves. We are at a point in our civilization
 where we can go to the store and find substitutes for milk, eggs, cheese, meats, honey, fish, and basically anything that could possibly come from an animal. In the three short months I've been plant based, I don't feel as though I've struggled to make any meal that I used to make. With these kind of options in our lives and our heightened intelligence, I think we have a 
responsibility to our planet to take care of it by not destroying it with mass harvesting, or by eating something which is not necessary to eat. So why do we still rely so heavily on eating animals and animal products?

**Simply put, It's not easy to make the change.**

When me and my girlfriend started this journey three months ago, not only were we met with resistance from others, we also didn't know what to eat. So many of my usual recipes and meals 
centralized around a meat protein like steak or chicken, and everything else complimented that. We had to do our fair share of research, test out different ingredients to see what was good 
and what wasn't, and put ourselves out there to try new recipes and find out what others were doing. Three months later we are now in our routine and we don't think we've missed out on 
any meat or animal eating. We feel better, and have even lost some weight. We don't miss eating animal products one bit.

## Not sold. Give me another reason please

Which brings me to the second point of why we chose to be plant based, the health benefits. 

Now, I'm not a nutritionalists and certainly can't science up the health benefits of plant based eating, but I know ther are **PLENTY** of resources out there that you can look up for yourself 
if you want to know more. For us, we watched the documentary on Netflix [The Game Changers](https://gamechangersmovie.com/). This is a documentary about the benefits of plant based eating vs normal diets. It's VERY well researched and an excellent resource to why you should try plant based eating yourself. From our own experience of plant based eating, we simply feel....good. I no longer get this sluggish, slow, sloth like feeling after eating a meal. I have more energy, I take less naps, I never feel bloated, my girlfriends skin was clearing up and looked better, and above all else, we were eating good foods. 

So you've read this far into my blog posts and you said to yourself, "Well, maybe the weird guy on the internet is on to something." If you think this is a lifestyle you want to try or 
you've been thinking about, then let me share with you some tips on how to make the journey a little easier, or what to expect. 

### 1. Plantbased foods are not going to tastes like their counterparts

I can't stress this enough. Vegan cheese IS NOT going to taste like normal cheese and if you expect it to, you will be dissapointed. Personally, I don't even think we should call vegan 
cheese "cheese" because it puts an expectation on the food itself. This rule also applies to most meats although food brands like Beyond Beef do an amazing job with how close they've 
gotten their foods to taste to the original. Simply put, be open minded to the new tastes. After some time eating these foods, I promise you won't even remember what chicken tastes like 
because you'll have a new expectation. 

### 2. If you don't cook at home, this will be a very hard journey

Because I already cook in my home quite often, it really wasn't a stretch for me to just cut out the meats in our meals or look up new recipes to make. Some people live in large cities, some 
don't. If you are one of the lucky ones like me who live near a large city (I live in the Orlando area) then the vegan or plant based options for eating out will be MUCH better than the ones 
if you live in a city like Lincoln Nebraska. Which brings me to why cooking is important. Regardless of where you live, vegan pre made food is usually more expensive and not that abundant. 
It would truly benefit you and make your new lifestyle much easier if you busted out the pots and pans and channeled your inner chef. 

### 3. Learn what your eating out options are

Over time you will find our what options are near you and where you can get certain ingredients or food. It is recommended to make a list of places you can frequent, and also a list of 
places you can go to at late hours. A lot of vegan places have earlier closing hours, so if you think you are going to be out late or you're not sure what places are open at 10 p.m. on a 
Monday, then it would benefit you greatly to find out before you get too hangry. 

### 4. Ease into it if you are unsure

When me and my girlfriend decided to embark on this journey, we went through our pantry and fridge and cleared out EVERYTHING that was not plantbased. Please don't throw this stuff out, 
give it away to family or friends. Even though it's meat or animal products, it's still food and someone could use it. 

You don't have to go into this hard charging though. You could always choose one night a week or two, where you and your family eat a plant based meal. This will ease you into the process 
and give you time to get the right ingredients and learn your routine. 

### 5. Stand your ground

You will likely meet resistance from others on this journey. This may include people shrugging you off, mocking, or even telling you that you might fail over a certain amount of time. 
Comments include but are not limited to:

- "Oh you're vegan? I'm sorry for your loss"
- "I've prepared a vegan option for you (Hands you a fern)"
- "Be sure to take your vitamins (Said the guy who eats Steak and Shake four times a week)"
- "Hey Jayson, that's a good looking almond milk latte, my girlfriend has a tampon you can borrow as well"

All joking aside, people will question you and your habits. Be prepared to explain yourself, and be confident in your decision. You don't need to impress anybody, you're doing this for you. 

### 6. You're allowed to set your own rules

Me and my girlfriend are plant based, but we talked about how strict we were going to be. We decided we don't care about things like if foods were made in a factory that also made milk 
products, or sometimes we can make exceptions for honey (we most of the time just use agave however). This is your change and you can do it however you'd like. If you only want to cut 
out chicken then do it. If you want to be dairy free then go for it. But most of all, be the change you want to see in others. 

### 7. Try different brands

During this short three month time frame, we have discovered brands that weren't so good, and others that were great. I could write a whole blog post on this topic alone, so all I'll say is 
be adventurous and try new things. You might have a bad experience with one brand of cheese, only to find out that there is another that tastes great. 

### 8. Plan for the holidays

We went plant based a few months before thanksgiving. When the holidays came around, we were questioned if we were going to eat Turkey and the simple answer was no. I did however, 
bring many vegan dishes to my mothers house along with a [Tofurky](https://tofurky.com/) for me, my girlfriend, and anyone else who wanted to try it. Needless to say, it was a very 
good thanksgiving. 

### 9. Respect others and their choices

I don't know who is reading this, but I just want you to know that if you want people to respect that the fact that you're plant based, then you have to respect the fact that they are not. 
Don't shame them and their choice to eat chicken or steak. Share your food with others, and show them that their are options out their, but be open minded with others. 

### 10. Don't punish your kids for eating meat

Just a disclaimer, I don't have kids. I have however, talked about this with my significant other and we both agree that if we had kids it would not be right to force them to always conform 
to a vegan diet if they didn't want to. For example, if they go out with friends then they are more than welcome to go outback steakhouse and chowdown on a ribeye if they so please. If they 
are at home, they should expect to eat what the chef of the house cooks. Rule 10 is a lot like rule 9. Respect others choices. 

## In Conclusion

I hope you found this posts insightful, helpful, or maybe it helped put you to sleep. Either way thanks for reading and I hope that you consider making the change like I and so many 
others have. Now go eat some good food!
