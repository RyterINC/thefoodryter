Lately I've been thinking about making dishes that use few ingredients. I got this bit of motivation from watching Netflixes show [Jamie's Quick and Easy Food](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/category/books/5-ingredients-quick-easy-food-recipes/).
I think it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking a dish needs "one more ingredient", rather than just using ingredients that are powerful and pair well. This recipe is easy 
to make, delicious and filling, a good dish for breakfast or brunch.

### Getting started

First things first, pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees. Then, we want to get out our portobellos and clean them. To do this, we will wipe down the caps gently with a damp paper towel. Mushrooms after all are fungus that 
grow on the ground, so we want to make sure we get them clean. For the portobellos we will spoon out the gills and remove the stem in the center. The gills are edible and this step is optional, but this will 
create a bowl so we can spoon in our ingredients later.

### Getting the tomatoes and mushrooms ready

We want to place the tomatoes and mushrooms on baking pans covered in foil. We coat the mushrooms with olive oil, and drizzle the olive oil on the tomatoes. Salt and pepper both, and put them to the side until the oven is ready. They will roast for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. About 8 minutes in, we want to flip the mushrooms. All timings may vary 
depending on the equipment you have.

### Sausage prep

Get your cast iron skillet out (you can do this on an oven safe pan as well) and pour in some olive oil and turn your stove on to medium high heat. Cut the sausage into bite size chunks. Once the iron is hot, drop in the sausage chunks and brown the sides. Once the outsides are seared, pop the skillet into the oven for roughly 5 to 10 minutes. 

### Polenta time

Pour 6 cups of water into a sauce pan and wait for it to boil. Once it boils, add in some salt and start to stream in the corn meal while whisking. You are going to use about 1 
cup of corn meal (this will produce quite a bit of polenta). This will start to thicken. Once it does, you can add in your butter and the parmessan. If you want it more buttery, 
just add in another half a stick. Salt to taste, and keep it warm.

### Out of the oven

Pull everything out of the oven (once it's done of course). Cut some tomatoes off of the vine, and get a plate out.

From here, we will plate it by putting down the mushroom, spooning some polenta on top, followed by adding the tomatoes and sausage. Grate some more parmessan on top of it all 
to seal the deal. You can take the left over polenta and put it in a square baking pan and throw it in the fridge. It will harden and you can cut squares out for later. Enjoy!
