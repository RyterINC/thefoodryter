Italian food is one of the things vegans don't get to experience as often since cheese and dairy are huge influencers. Rest easy knowing this dish will fulfill those desires and leave you with plenty of leftovers!

## Ingredients / Preparations

### Lasagna

- Lasagna Pasta 16oz.
- Tomato Sauce 24 oz. (or marinara)
- Vegan Mozzarella 8oz. (I used Miyoko's brand)
- Vegan Ricotta 2 cups (You can either buy premade, or make your own which I do to save money)
- Vegan Italian sausage 12oz. (optional) (I used [No Evil's](https://www.noevilfoods.com/products/the-stallion/) brand, feel free to swap for your own preference)
- Fresh Basil .75oz.
- Fresh Oregano .75oz. 
- Spinach 20 oz. (You can use fresh or frozen)
- 9 x 13 casserole dish
- Salt and pepper as needed

### Ricotta

> If you decide to opt out of buying ricotta, check out my [ricotta recipe here](https://thefoodryter.com/vegan-ricotta/). 

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
2. Fill a large pot with cold water and bring to a boil
3. Once boiling, add 1 Tbsp of salt to the pot
4. Add in about 5 lasagna noodles at a time to the pot, stirring frequently until al dente (Still firm when bitten ~9-11 minutes)
5. If you are making the ricotta from the above recipe, add all the ingredients into a blender or food proccessor and blend until very whipped and smooth. There shouldn't be any almonds left intact. 
6. For the spinach, add 1/4 cup of water to a sautee pan or skillet over medium heat, bring water to a boil, add in the spinach and cover until wilted. 

### Lasagna Assembly

>You can layer a lasagna any way you'd like. The important things to remember however is step 1, and ensuring you get tomato sauce on the sides or wherever pasta is touching the dish. Since most tomato sauces have olive oil, this will prevent the lasagna from sticking when in the oven. 

1. Coat the bottom of the caserrole dish with a thin layer of tomato sauce
2. Put down the first layer of lasagna noodles side by side on the bottom of the pan. 
3. coat the noodles in pasta sauce
>How much sauce you want is up to you. I don't generally like my lasagna very saucy since I don't want a "wet" lasagna
4. In any order, add mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, spinach, oregano, and basil. When adding the spinach, try not include any water as a result of cooking. 
>Be mindful of how much of each ingredient you use for each layer. You want to use everything, without having too much on any one layer of the dish. 
5. Add some more sauce before adding the next layer of lasagna noodles. 
6. Repeat these steps until you reach the top, where the top layer should be lasagna noodles with tomato sauce spread on top.
>At this point, I like to make sure I get a bit of tomato sauce down the sides to ensure non sticking lasagna.
7. Cover, and put it in the oven for 1 hour. After 40 minutes, take out of the oven and add another layer of mozzarella. Finish off the lasagna for the remaining 20 minutes uncovered.

## In Conclusion

This dish will feed two people for about 4 days and is really good for leftovers. I had some extra ingredients like some extra lasagna noodles, and some basil and oregano as my local grocery doesn't sell fresh herbs in smaller sizes than .75oz (I'm working on growing my own again). Feel free to customize this dish, as lasagna is super versatile. I hope you enjoy this recipe, and if you made it please share if there is anything you did differently. Enjoy!
