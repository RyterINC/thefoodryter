I made this from a need to not spend a ton of money on Kitehill brands Ricotta when I made lasagna. This is almond based, with various spices to give it a bit of flavor. Put it on pizza, lasagna, crackers, anything you'd like. It has a low profile but is a great compliment to most dishes that need a ricotta like flavor or filling. 

## Ingredients

- Slivered almonds 10oz. 
- 2tbsp Lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp Onion powder
- 1/2 tsp Garlic powder
- 1/8 tsp white pepper
- 1/2 tsp Oregano
- 1/2 tsp Parsley
- 1 tsp Sugar (Omit for whole foods plant based)
- 1 1/4 cup Almond milk
- Salt to taste

## Steps

1. Combine all ingredients into a food processor
2. Blend until very whipped. There should be no almonds left in tact. 
3. Taste and add spices / salt as needed
> If you're like me and have a ninja or blender, then this can be kind of tedious as you will constantly have to mix / push down the blend in order to fully whip it. 

## In Conclusion

This is a super easy blend that is feeling and simple to make. I hope you enjoy!
