### Ingredients

**Mashed Potatoes**
- 6 - golden potatoes (quartered)
- 1/2 cup - vegan butter
- 1/2 cup - vegan sour cream or cream cheese (This is more of a preference regarding which one you use)
- ~ 3/4 ounce - chives (cut about an 1/8 of an inch thick or smaller)
- Salt and pepper to taste

>This will produce a pretty thick layer of mash. If you want less mash than what you see in the picture down below, feel free to use one less potato

**Mince**
- 2 - 15.5 ounce cans canellini beans
- 1 - 6 ounce can of tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon - red wine
- 1 tablespoon - dried thyme OR 5-6 sprigs fresh (taste preference)
- 1 tablespoon - dried rosemary OR 2-3 sprigs fresh (taste preference)
- 4 - garlic cloves (minced)
- 1 - medium yellow onion (diced)
- 1 cup - vegetable stock
- 1 cup - frozen peas
- 1 - large carrot (grated)
- 1/2 cup - grated vegan parmessan
- 2 tbsp - Olive Oil
- salt and pepper to taste

### Steps

1. In a pot with cold water, add potatoes and a tablespoon of salt. 
2. Bring to boil, let cook for about 20 min or until tender enough for a mash. (should be able to pierce with fork)
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees
4. In a Cast Iron Skillet, add Olive Oil, and turn stove to medium high heat
5. Add onions, cook about 5 minutes
7. Add Garlic, cook about 2-3 minutes or until fragrant
8. Add beans, tomato paste, carrot, thyme, rosemary - Mix until heated through
9. Add red wine - cook about 2 minutes
10. Add vegetable stock, reduce to medium heat, let simmer until mince has reached desired thickness (shouldn't be to wet)
11. Turn off heat, add frozen peas and mix into mince

>Taste the mince at this point and add any seasonings as needed

>Potatoes should be done at this point (if this is too much too manage, you can always cook the potatoes first and keep them warm in the pot until they are needed)

12. Turn off heat for potatoes, drain the water. 
13. Add Butter, salt, pepper, cream cheese or sour cream, and chives to potatoes. Mash until they reach desired consistency. Everyone likes their potatoes different, I prefer mine to be rather smooth. 

>Taste the potatoes as you mash so you can adjust ingredients to your liking

14. Spread potatoes out over mince evenly, sprinkle parmessan on top
15. Put skillet into the oven for about 15 or 20 min, or until potatoes have browned
16. Consume until you have a food comma
