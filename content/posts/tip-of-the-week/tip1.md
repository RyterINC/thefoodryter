### Ever wonder how to get the tough stuff off your iron?

I use my cast iron skillet A LOT. With the even heating and added flavor bonus you get from the seasoning, I feel like it just makes all my food taste better. 
If I'm just shallow frying, I can usually just wipe out the oils and all is good and well in the world. However, occasionally I'll cook something that leaves some 
food still on the pan that is rather tough to get off and requires a bit of elbow grease. I've read on plenty of forums on how to clean a pan, and some people 
suggest brillo pads, since they can give a good scrub but not get so deep that is ruins your cast iron seasoning. Personally, I hate brillo pads. You use them, then you 
have to store them somewhere or throw them away and they are just another thing you have to buy. Some people buy cast iron scrubs which are fine, but just another thing you 
need and they might work, they might not. 

### Enter aluminum foil

What's not to love? you take off a little strip of foil, wad it up, then scrub it out. Throw it away when you're done and just wipe out your skillet with a paper towel 
after. What's great about this solution is everyone who cooks already has aluminum foil in their kitchen, and it gives the same affect of a brillo pad. you can gently 
scrape the surface of your pan without worrying about wrecking your seasoning. The aluminum foil will also shape to the edges of your pan when you scrub so you can 
get the edges well. If you can't get it out with the wad of foil, just boil some water with some lemon juice for about 10 minutes in your pan and scrub it clean after. 
I've never had anything stick after that and I'm confident you won't either. Enjoy!  

### TLDR (For you lazies. You know who you are)

Take a strip of aluminum foil, ball it up, scrub your pan.
