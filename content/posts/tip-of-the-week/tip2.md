### Thought you had mastered scrambled eggs? 

I think scrambled eggs is one of those things that most people have cooked but few have cooked correctly. I know I am guilty of it myself, 
as for my birthday this year my girlfriend purchased me MasterClass and I watched Gordon Ramsay's class on cooking scrambled eggs. Now, this is the tip of the week so I'm 
not here to tell you how to cook scrambled eggs like Gordon Ramsay, but I am here to tell you what the secret ingredient to a well made scrambled eggs is. 

### Crème fraîche

If you can't pronounce it, that's totally fine, it is french after all. Basically, this ingredient is a thickened cream closely related to sour cream or plain 
greek yogurt (both of which are good substitutes). To use it in your eggs, simply right before your eggs are "done", add in a spoonful of creme and stir it into your eggs.
 This is going to do two things: 

1. It will stop your eggs from cooking
2. It will make them creamy and more runny

Americans tend to like their eggs really overcooked, so this style is catered more towards eggs that aren't rock hard after you're done cooking, but either way you'll get 
creamy eggs that will really make your simple dish sing. Enjoy!
