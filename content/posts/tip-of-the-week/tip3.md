### Kales Good, but it can be better

For a long time, whenever I've eaten kale it usually came straight out of the bag, and most people (including myself) complained about the taste because it was too bitter. It's no secret that a lot of people don't particularly like eating raw kale, as it lacks (good) flavor. 

As it would turn out, it's all in the preparation. I remember when I learned about this, I was copying an online recipe for a quinoa kale salad, and the instructions for the kale was to add lemon juice, olive oil, and salt. Then, you would massage the kale crunching it in your hand. This would bring out the deep green color in the kale, as well as infuse the leaves with the flavor of the juices and the salt. This. Was. Game. Changing. 

I don't think I've eaten kale since and didn't use this method of prep for a fresh kale dish. The flavor was completely transformed and my dish tasted much better, and the kale having a much brighter taste with the lemon juice and salt.

### Easy to replicate

To do this yourself, simply do the following: 

1. Pour your kale into a mixing bowl
2. Add salt, olive oil and lemon juice. The quantity of lemon juice and olive oil should be just enough to coat the kale, and not drench it like a salad dressing. 
3. With both hands, grab chunks of kale and squeeze the chunks in your hand like you're using a stress ball. 
4. repeat this process and taste, adding more lemon juice or salt as necessary.
